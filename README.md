## 🔖 About this repository
This repository tracks my **Full Stack Developer (FSD)** learning journey.  
I use a day-by-day folder structure to practice and build small projects that become portfolio pieces.

---

## 📅 Day-wise Progress

### 📌 Day 01 — HTML + CSS Foundation
- Created a semantic HTML structure with `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `section`, `aside`, and `footer`.
- Built a responsive two-column layout (content + sidebar) using Flexbox.
- Practiced forms and semantic tags.
- Final files:
  - `Day_01/index.html`
  - `Day_01/styles.css`

*(More days and projects will be added as I progress.)*
