            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML is the structural foundation of every webpage. It defines content using tags like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Without HTML, a browser cannot understand what to display. It organizes information logically so users and search engines can interpret it. Every web project always begins with clean, semantic HTML.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS controls the visual appearance of a webpage. It styles colors, layouts, fonts, spacing, animations, and overall design. With CSS, raw HTML becomes attractive and user-friendly. Modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid make responsive layouts simple. Good CSS enhances user experience, readability, and the overall professional feel of any web interface.</p>

        <div class="Box ">
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to websites. It enables dynamic features such as forms, pop-ups, sliders, animations, and real-time updates. JS can interact with APIs, modify HTML, and respond to user actions. Modern JavaScript powers full applications through frameworks. It transforms static pages into functional, engaging, and intelligent web experiences.</p>
